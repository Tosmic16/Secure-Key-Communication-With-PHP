# Secure-Key-Authentication(SKA)-With-PHP

## Overview

The Secure Key Authentication (SKA) is a custom client-server communication protocol designed to facilitate secure authentication and data exchange between a client and a server. It achieves this through the use of cryptographic keys, ensuring that sensitive information is protected during transmission.

## Key Components

1. **Client-Side Implementation**:
   - The client initializes a connection to the server.
   - It reads a challenge from the server.
   - Using its private key, it generates a cryptographic signature for the challenge.
   - The client sends the signature back to the server for verification.

2. **Server-Side Implementation**:
   - The server listens for incoming connections from clients.
   - It generates a random challenge and sends it to the client.
   - The server verifies the received signature using the client's public key.
   - Based on the verification result, it sends an authentication status back to the client.

## Purpose

The purpose of SKA is to establish a secure channel for authentication. By utilizing cryptographic keys, it ensures that data exchanged between the two parties remains confidential and tamper-proof.
